Beave's Blog 
============

I've been involved in computer security since before it was an industry.   I started "hacking" 
in mid 1980's and I haven't stop.  I've written books, white papers and given talks at conferences
like Defcon, HOPE, CCC and Suricon.   I've been programming for 30 years (Perl, C, PHP, etc). 

I am the CTO at Quadrant Information Security (https://quadrantsec.com) which is an awesome place
to work.  I'm the primary developer of the `Sagan Log Analysis Engine <https://sagan.io>`_ and 
`Meer <https://quadrantsec.com/meer>`_.  Thoughts, ideas and opinions expressed in this blog are my 
own.

Linux junkie since the early 90s.  Unix enthusiast before that.  OpenVMS administrator.  
Occasional "software defined" radio hacker. 

I like do things.  Many of them involve computers.  IRL - I travel as much as possible around the
world with my family.  I play Bass.  I play Guitar.  I play Drums.
