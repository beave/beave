Beave's Blog 
============

I've been involved in computer security since before it was an industry.   I started "hacking" 
in mid 1980's and haven't stop.  I've written books, white papers and given talks at conferences
like Defcon, HOPE, CCC, Suricon, various ISSA events around the Unified States, etc.  I've been 
programming for nearly 40 years (Perl, C, PHP, etc). 

I am the CTO at Quadrant Information Security (https://quadrantsec.com) which is an awesome place
to work.  I'm the primary developer of the `Sagan Log Analysis Engine <https://sagan.io>`_ and 
`Meer <https://quadrantsec.com/meer>`_. 

Linux junkie since the early 90s.  Unix enthusist before that.  OpenVMS administrator.  
Ocasional "software defined" radio hacker.  

I like do things.  Many of them involve computers.  IRL - I travel as much as possible around the
world with my family.  I play Bass.  I play Guitar.  I play Drums.  

Thoughts, ideas and opinions expressed here are not a reflection of Quadrant Information Security.
